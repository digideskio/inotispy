Prerequisites
-------------

In order for you to run these scripts you'll need to install a few libraries
from the CPAN (or yum or apt if they exist in those repositories.) For a
CPAN install do the following:

  $ cpan ZeroMQ JSON

To find packages pre-built for your OS try doing:

  # Debian
  $ aptitude search libzeromq-perl
  $ aptitude search libjson-perl

  # RedHat, CentOS, CloudLinux
  $ yum search zeromq | grep perl
  $ yum search json | grep perl
