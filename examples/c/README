Building
--------

Just type the following to build each program:

  $ make

And to clean up when you're done:

  $ make clean

Parsing JSON
------------

Parsing JSON in C isn't terribly fun, but there are a number of JSON parsing
libraries out there for you to try out. Inotispy uses a library called json-c
which has a slick, minimal, interface and if used properly contains no memory
leaks. If you're writing your client applications in C then you might want to
take a look at json-c as your parsing library.

Obviously you can dig through the Inotispy source code to see how it's being
used, but also take a look at the following file for a more focused example
of how to use it:

  examples/c/get_events.c

You can download json-c from here:
