.SH NAME
inotispy \- efficient inotify daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B inotispy [--silent]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Inotispy is an efficient file system change notification daemon based on the
.BR inotify
kernel module. It recursively watches directory trees, queues file system
events that occur within those trees, and delivers those events to client
applications via
.BR ZeroMQ
sockets.
.SH LANGUAGE BINDINGS
Inotispy provides an interface sutable for calling from programs in any language.
Included with the Inotispy distribution are code samples with examples
in several different languages. However, because this daemon is built on top of
.BR ZeroMQ
the best alternative resource would be the
.BR zmq (7)
documentation itself.
