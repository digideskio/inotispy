PREREQUISITES
-------------

Inotispy has a few dependencies that you must check for/install
before compiling and running it.

 * inotify  - Your system must be equipped with inotify.

 * pthreads - Your system must support pthreads.

Some of these may already be packaged up in your distro's package
